# Safe Driving Peripheral Project

This project aims to enhance the safety features of vehicles by implementing various sensors and modules controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The system includes the following components:

- Buzzer
- Flame sensor
- IR sensor
- MQ3 sensor (Gas sensor)
- Sonar (Ultrasonic sensor)
- GSM module
- LCD display

## Overview

The Safe Driving Peripheral Project integrates multiple sensors and modules to provide real-time monitoring and alerts for safer driving experiences. Each component serves a specific purpose in ensuring driver and passenger safety.

## Components

- **Buzzer:** Provides audible alerts for critical events such as proximity warnings or sensor triggers.
  
- **Flame Sensor:** Detects the presence of flames, providing early warnings for potential fire hazards.

- **IR Sensor:** Helps in detecting obstacles or objects in the vehicle's path, aiding in collision avoidance.

- **MQ3 Sensor (Gas Sensor):** Monitors gas levels within the vehicle, detecting any abnormal concentrations that may pose health risks.

- **Sonar (Ultrasonic Sensor):** Measures distances to objects, assisting in parking and obstacle detection.

- **GSM Module:** Enables communication capabilities for sending SMS alerts in case of emergencies or critical events.

- **LCD Display:** Provides visual feedback and status information to the driver, enhancing situational awareness.
